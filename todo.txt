#to do

in dowload.py:
- catch errors in download when data are not availble or iridl is down
- fix CanSips download error
- implement stop button


in forecast.py

- save tercile and cem categories as geojson
- include skill-masked plots
- include more skill measures
- data saving - diagnostics - regression model diags - error distribution, obs vs predicted
- save model configuration to output directory

- test data ingestion errors for csv files
- add missing value to gui
- add category of predictand to gui
- add "too dry to forecast" colour to plots
- limit CCA forecast for less than X locations/zones

# wish list:
- implement download from CDS, and if not - implement download of CDS data from IRIDL - both require users to set up account
- multimodel forecast
- filling missing values in predictand
- regridding of gridded predictand to a coarser resolution if domain too large
- optimize skill calculation on gridded data - it takes much longer than calculations of the model
- parameters that are not defined throug gui to be read from json file (in this way, advanced users can change them)
