#to do
- create installer - most likely 

in dowload.py:
- implement control of lat lon to make sure integers within range
- implement download and processing of forecast data

in forecast.py

- extend and clean up plotting 
- include skill-masked plots
- catch error when some zones get dropped if spatial aggregation is used
- include more skill measures
- data saving - diagnostics - results of pca and cca
- test data ingestion errors for csv files
- add missing value to gui
- add category of predictand to gui
- add buttons to clear file selectors to gui
- add "too dry to forecast" colour to plots
- implement ability to use forecast data as predictor - it should work even now, but there is a need to make sure dates are handled correctly.

# wish list:
- multimodel forecast
- filling missing values in predictand
- regridding of gridded predictand to a coarser resolution if domain too large
- optimize skill calculation on gridded data - it takes much longer than calculations of the model
- parameters that are not defined throug gui to be read from json file (in this way, advanced users can change them)
